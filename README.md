What is it?
-----------

**stop** is a wrapper code for the 
[Serpent Monte Carlo code](http://montecarlo.vtt.fi). 
The code is written in Matlab and allows automated generation 
and execution of Serpent input files. The code also generates 
[PARCS](https://engineering.purdue.edu/PARCS) compatible XSEC cards.

Inspired by B. Herman's [SerpentXS](http://canes.github.com/SerpentXS/).
Developed at [FAST](http://fast.web.psi.ch/) under supervision of Dr. K. Mikityuk.
Initial version of the code and simulation results are reported 
[here](http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-118072).
Final polishing of the code was encouraged and supported by Prof. W. Gudowski 
at [KTH](http://www.neutron.kth.se/).
